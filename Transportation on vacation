Transportation on vacation

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

INPUT-1:
1
OUTPUT-1:
40
INPUT-2:
3
OUTPUT-2:
100

import java.util.*;
public class Transport{
  public static int rentalCarCost(int d) {
      int sum=0;
      if(d>=3)
      {
          
      for(int i=1;i<=d;i++)
      {
          
          sum=sum+40;
      }
      return sum-20;
      }
      else if(d>=7)
      {
          for(int i=1;i<=d;i++)
          {
              sum=sum+40;
          }
          return sum-50;
      }
      else 
      {
          for (int i=1;i<=d;i++)
          {
              sum=sum+40;
          }
          return sum;
      }
  }
