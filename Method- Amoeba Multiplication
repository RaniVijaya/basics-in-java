Method- Amoeba Multiplication

The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]

Sample input and Output 1:

Enter the number of Months :

7

The amoeba size is 8

Sample input and Output 2:

Enter the number of Months :

12

The amoeba size is 89

import java.util.*;
public class Amoeba
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n;
        System.out.println("Enter the number of Months :");
        n=sc.nextInt();
        Multi m=new Multi();
       // n3=sc.nextInt();
       System.out.println("The amoeba size is " +m.mul(n));
    }
}
       class Multi{
           public static int mul(int n)
           {
             int n1=0,n2=1;
            int n3=n2;
        for(int i=3;i<n;i++)
        {
        n1=n2;
        n2=n3;
        n3=n1+n2;
        
        
    }
    return n3;
    
}
}
