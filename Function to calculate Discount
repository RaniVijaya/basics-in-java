    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int item=sc.nextInt();
     
        int discount=sc.nextInt();
        int total = item;
        float discountedPrice = (float)total-(total/100)*discount;
        System.out.printf("%.2f",discountedPrice);
        
    }
}
